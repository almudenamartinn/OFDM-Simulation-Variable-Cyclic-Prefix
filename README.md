# OFDM-Simulation-Variable-Cyclic-Prefix
This repository contains an OFDM simulation using 16-QAM modulation, evaluating the impact of different cyclic prefix lengths on symbol error probability. The code includes bit generation, modulation, transmission over a noisy channel, and error probability calculation.
